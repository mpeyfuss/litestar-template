# Litestar Template
Not sure I'd call this a template really as the packages here may change quickly. 

Overall after playing with it a bit, there is a lot to like about Piccolo + Litestar. You get some features that feels Django-like, which can boost productivity. There are also other features that are a bit different, but manageable. 

Main thing is that you have to glue a lot of stuff together to get it all to work. And all you get with that imo is "more modern" python, whatever that means.

Most people are better off building with DRF to take advantage of all it's built out features... paginiation, sessions, etc.

Only use litestar + piccolo if you really need too imo.
